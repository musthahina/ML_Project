# 🚗 Car Price Prediction  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project aims to develop a **predictive model for car prices** using various machine learning algorithms. A Chinese automobile company is expanding into the **US market** and wants to understand the key factors that influence car prices.  

By analyzing a dataset of cars sold in the US, we aim to:  

- ✅ Identify **significant variables** affecting car prices.  
- ✅ Develop **machine learning models** for price prediction.  
- ✅ Compare different models based on performance metrics.  
- ✅ Provide **business insights** to help the company **strategize its market entry**.

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset used in this project is sourced from **market surveys** and contains multiple attributes of cars sold in the **US market**.  

## 🛠️ Project Workflow  

### **1️⃣ Data Loading & Preprocessing**  
✔ Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.  
✔ Handle **missing values** and remove **duplicates**.  
✔ Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**.  
✔ Encode **categorical variables** (e.g., One-Hot Encoding, Label Encoding).  
✔ Normalize/scale **numerical features** for consistency.  
✔ Remove **outliers** to improve model performance.

### **2️⃣ Model Implementation**  
We implemented **five regression models** to predict car prices:  

1. 🔹 **Linear Regression**  
2. 🔹 **Decision Tree Regressor**  
3. 🔹 **Random Forest Regressor**  
4. 🔹 **Gradient Boosting Regressor**  
5. 🔹 **Support Vector Regressor (SVR)**

### **3️⃣ Model Evaluation**  
Each model was evaluated using the following performance metrics:  

📊 **R-Squared Score (R²)** – Measures how well the model explains the variability in car prices.  
📊 **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** – Measures average squared error between actual and predicted prices.  
📊 **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** – Measures the average absolute difference between actual and predicted prices.  

---

### **4️⃣ Feature Importance Analysis**  
🔍 Identified **key features** affecting car prices using:  
✔ **Statistical methods** (correlation analysis).  
✔ **Model-based techniques** (feature importance scores from tree-based models).  
✔ **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)** for feature selection.

### **5️⃣ Hyperparameter Tuning**  
🎯 To improve model performance, we applied:  
🔹 **Grid Search** – Systematic search over specified parameter values.  
🔹 **Randomized Search** – Random combinations of hyperparameters for faster tuning.  
🔹 **Cross-Validation** – Ensuring the model generalizes well to unseen data.  

📈 **Optimized model accuracy** using fine-tuned hyperparameters.
