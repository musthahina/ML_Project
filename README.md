Car Price Prediction

Project Overview

This project aims to develop a predictive model for car prices using various machine learning algorithms. A Chinese automobile company is entering the US market and wants to understand the key factors affecting car prices in the American market. By analyzing a dataset of cars sold in the US, we aim to determine which features significantly impact pricing and build an accurate model for price prediction.

Business Objective

Identify the most significant variables influencing car prices.

Develop machine learning models to predict car prices.

Compare different models based on performance metrics.

Provide insights to help the company strategize their market entry.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from market surveys and contains multiple attributes of cars in the US market. It can be accessed here.

Project Workflow

1. Data Loading and Preprocessing

Load the dataset.

Handle missing values.

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).

Encode categorical variables.

Normalize/scale numerical features.

Remove duplicate entries and outliers.

2. Model Implementation

Implemented five regression models:

Linear Regression

Decision Tree Regressor

Random Forest Regressor

Gradient Boosting Regressor

Support Vector Regressor (SVR)

3. Model Evaluation

Evaluated models using:

R-Squared Score

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

4. Feature Importance Analysis

Used statistical methods and model-based techniques to identify significant features.

Applied feature selection techniques like correlation analysis and importance scores.

5. Hyperparameter Tuning

Applied Grid Search and Random Search for optimal model performance.

Improved model accuracy using fine-tuned hyperparameters.

Results & Insights

The best performing model was identified based on evaluation metrics.

Important features affecting car prices were determined.

Business recommendations were provided based on findings.
